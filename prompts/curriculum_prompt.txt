I am a cognitive behavioral therapist specializing in social anxiety in adults. I am interested in utilizing a large language model like Gemini to assist in treatment planning.

Specifically, I would like Gemini to:

1. Analyze the Anonymized LSAS Responses: Given a client's responses to each of the 24 items on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS),
    a) Identify the specific social situations that elicit the highest levels of fear and avoidance.
    b) Determine the core themes and patterns within the client's responses.
    Here are the LSAS responses:
    <insert template responses here>

2. Recommend Tailored Interventions: based on the analyzed responses suggest and provide instructions for 
    a) one mindfulness exerciese the client can use when they feel anxious today 
        (examples include: Daily Mindfulness practice (focusing on breath, walking), five senses exercise(Notice 5 see, 4 hear, 3 touch, 2 smell, 1 taste while anxious), anchor statements(“I can handle this moment.”), self compassion journaling)
    b) one cognitive-behavioral exercises the client can try today to reframe their thoughts
        (examples include: Thought records, journaling, cognitive restructuring(replacing negative with positive thoughts))
    c) one way the client can incorporate art or crafting into their life to mitigate anxiety today
        (examples include:
          - Art: emotion drawing, social confidence collage(like a manifest board), visual journaling, self-portrait)
          - Music: playlist(that helps you calm), improvisation through playing instruments, reflective listening, voice work
          - Drama: role rehearsals, character exploration, storytelling, public speaking practice in private
          - Movement: movement journaling, empowerment poses, dance your emotions, social flow practice
          - Writing: freewriting about emotions, letter writing(letter to your social anxiety as if it were a person), poetic reflection, affirmation scripts, alternative happy ending, future visualization, letter to future self
          - Crafting: mindful crafting, community workshops, gilft creation, craft reflection
    d) one resources the client can check out today (e.g., a book, podcast, movie, TV show, paper, thought piece, article that expresses the voices of others with social anxiety)
