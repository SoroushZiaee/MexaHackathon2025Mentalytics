# TheraAssist: AI-Powered Homework Generator for Clinicians

Project for MEXA (Mental Health x AI) hackathon.

TherAssist is an AI-powered assistant designed to help clinicians create personalized homework assignments for clients. Clinicians provide assessment surveys, which clients complete, and the AI analyzes this data to generate customized, research-backed exercises. These exercises are delivered through a mobile app that sends reminders and notifications to support homework completion. Clinicians retain full control, selecting the most relevant exercises to ensure quality, appropriateness, and minimal burden on clients. By streamlining homework creation, TherAssist enhances therapeutic outcomes while reducing cliniciansâ€™ workload! 

In this version, we focused on clients who work from home and experience social anxiety. We used the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) for assessment. As clients complete the survey, clinicians receive their responses along with Gemini's analysis and personalized homework recommendations. This helps clinicians quickly assess social anxiety levels, track progress over time, and provide targeted interventions more efficiently.
